               <p>
                  Did you know that "Sushi" comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's the rice that's at the heart of sushi, even though most people think of it as raw fish. In fact, it's the word sashimi that refers to a piece of raw fish.
                  When you eat sushi, you might eat cooked egg and rice, avocado and rice, or cooked fish and rice, as well as sushi made with raw fish and rice.
               </p>
               <p>Here, at Spice Girls + 1, we will take your sushi experience to the next level with our signature "Samurai rolls".
                  They are prepared fresh daily from the finest and fresh organic ingredients such as vinegared brown rice, Atlantic salmon, cucumber,
                  avocado, caviar and the secret in-house spice mix to add the distinct flavor that we're sure you'll enjoy, all wrapped into a sheet of
                  seaweed.
                  There are seafood add-on options available: choose from shrimp, squid or octopus .

               <p>A perfect medium-cooked flaky, juicy and delicious salmon with crispy pan-seared skin, spiced with garlic, ginger, soy sauce,
                  rice wine vinegar and sesame oil and glazed with sweet and tangy sesame teriyaki sauce. All cooked to perfection in the oven with a passion for bringing the best out of the food. Served with fresh veggies, spinach, zucchini, asparagus and caramelized onion.

               <p>Stew is a comfort food in Korea, and this spicy Korean stew won't disappoint. It's filling, warm, and simply delicious.
                  You'll usually see home-made noodle, octopus, squid, shrimp, and mussels with garden veggies in a fiery red soup base. Like many Korean stews, jampong can be adjusted for different spice levels and flavor preferences. Vary your kochukaru (red pepper powder) to your taste and your spice level preference. Served boiling hot in a traditional Korean stone bowl.

               <h3 id="sec4">STEAK TACOS &ndash; &dollar; 10.00</h3>
               <p>It's very easy to make a taco - use flank steak made of a lean cut of beef, grill the steak at high heat, allow the steak to
                  rest for 10 minutes before slicing so you donâ€™t lose all of the juice and flavor, cut the steak across the grain and serve the steak tacos with your favorite toppings, like red onion, avocado slices, cilantro and queso fresco. Or come to Spice Gilrs +1 and order these incredible mouth-watering specialty tacos spiced with original Mexican spice and seasoning blend.
